# Stats 504 Project
Code and data for Statistics 504

We'll be analyzing (tentatively) the relationship between Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Dementia.  The data is provided by the Allen Brain Institute, based on their "Aging, Dementia, and TBI" study, which is a sub-project of the broader "Adult Changes in Thought" (ACT) study.  The ACT study is organized by the University of Washington and the Kaiser Permanente Health Research Institute for the longitudinal analysis of the relationship between brain aging and incident dementia in the Seattle metropolitan area.

Included in this Allen Institute dataset are study participant metadata, quantitative histology and protein measurements of neuropathology, and RNA-sequencing (seq) analyses of the hippocampus and neocortex.

Preprocessing by the Allen Institute included between-sample normalization of RNA-seq counts within a given region (hippocampus, parietal cortex, etc.) -- both the unnormalized and normalized data are available, but we use the normalized data for our analysis.
